# YearPercentage
This "program" will show how much percent has passed from the beginning of the year on a specific date.

## install & launch
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdraugr/Year_Percentage ~/YearPercentage
cd ~/YearPercentage bash ./start.sh
```
Let me tell you how to work this it.

One common output of program:
```
========================
          2020
========================
============
   February
============
1 8.4699%
2 8.7432%
2 9.0000% 22:34
3 9.0164%
4 9.2896%
5 9.5628%
6 9.8361%
6 10.0000% 14:24
...
```
* Number betwen two long equals sign rows is year. 
* Number betwen two short equals sign rows is month. 

2 8.7432% means that, 2nd Feb of 2020 at 00:00 will be 8.7432% of 2020 year. 

If smf is written after "%", for example 2 9.0000% 22:34, read it like:

2nd Feb of 2020 at 22:34 will be 9% of 2020 year. 

So simply, how you can see!

! Warning !
At this project I tell that year is 365 (366) days (without 1/4+)

Thanks for having interes to this project. Good luck
